# Frontend-Task
In this implementation:

The HTML file contains interactive elements (buttons and links).
The CSS file styles the interactive elements and provides a visual indicator for selected elements.
The JavaScript file adds event listeners to the interactive elements, allowing users to select and deselect them. When an element is selected, **a simulated event is sent to the console, indicating the type of element** (e.g., "button", "link") and its text.
